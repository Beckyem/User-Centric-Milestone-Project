# Testing Plan
The following are the intended series of tests intended to guide me to a better, working website. Starting with:
### Deployment
1. Launch initial dummy template as website on Github Pages and follow link.
2. Ensure all links to favicon/files and images still work (that you've used relative file pathing instead of absolute).
3. Search for deployed website using meta tags inserted into header with a search engine and see how long it takes to find (amend tags as necessary to make it easier).
### File Links (Internal)
1. Test that the styels.css is correctly linked to the documents with striking colors.
2. Amend / Remove after successful test.
### Hyperlinks (Internal)
1. Click on each navigation link to see if it takes you to the next page.
2. Click on each anchor link to see if it takes you to the right part of the page.
### Hyperlinks (External)
1. Ensure link opens url in new tab by clicking on them.
### Responsive Check
1. Drag widnow left and right to ensure all internal elements resize/reorganise as intended.
2. Ensure any images (set to change per screen width) switch to resolution appropriate equivalents.
### Image Descriptions
1. Remove href atribute from image elements in HTML files to see if the alt attribute correctly displays description of image.
### Code Validation
1. Insert deployed webpage(s) code into the W3C HTML Validator and amend any/all errors.
2. Insert deployed webpage stylesheet into W3C Jackbox Validator and amend any/all errors.

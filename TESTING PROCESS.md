# Testing Process
The following is how testing progressed in the designated areas:
### Deployment
1. Got the dummy website up on Github Pages with no issues.
2. Favicon and stylesheet were readily apparent, meaning the file links worked as intended (had not added any images at this stage).
3. 
### File Links (Internal)
1. On launch, the style.css file was already working as intended - imported fonts showed clearly.
2. Continued to check over the elements in the deployed website as I spaced them out - took some tweaking, but got there in the end.
3. Removed awful initial colouring of the header, main, and footer elements.
### Hyperlinks (Internal)
1. Tried out each item in the navigation section and was brought to the specified pages (and back again, when on the Camps or Parks page).
2. 
### Hyperlinks (External)
1. Tested each link to social media sites - they launch in new tabs as intended.
### Responsive Check
1. Tested the webpage in different device resolutions to see how both the header and footer responded (had some minor tweaking to do, but it was fine) - no real main elements at this stage to test.
2. 
### Image Descriptions
